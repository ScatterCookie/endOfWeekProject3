What is thsi?

We as a group were individually asked to create a an interactive game in the style fo a cookie clicker. games like these are Idle games are in the industry a more technical term would be incremental games.
The task was to create a cookie clicker with an incremental feature allowing you to collect cookies while you play and invest in the shop purchases available to be able to accumulate more cookies as you progress.

To deploy this I used the given github deployment method which allows us to make this a working website which you can access anywhere.
Go to the project GitHub repo
Go to ‘Settings’
In the sidebar, go to ‘Pages’
In ‘Build and Deployment’ > ‘Branch’, select the ‘main’ branch from the drop-down and save
Wait a minute or so, and your website is deployed!

As you can see from the page that has loaded you are able to clikc the cookie and are able to collect cookies to purchase upgrades, the counter goes up incrementally every second and any upgrades bought are added to your Cookies Per Second.

What I was able to acheive?

I started on the game early in the week to get a good headstart, I was able to implement all of the basic criteria as well as some of the bonus, I did add a music track but for some reason I could not get this to function correctly, not sure if this has something to do with my browser so i did remove this as it didn't play well with my code.

Some of the mistakes made along the way were small and trivial, like semi-colon here and missing perenthesis there, minor errors which took the majority of my time to solve.

Overall, not a bad project in my opinion and hoping to push further into the bootcamp.
